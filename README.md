# Designing Voice Assistants
#### Purpose
This repository contains logic for devices being developed for
the University of Maryland's Human Computer Interaction Lab.
Current project topics include devices meant for use by people
living with forms of Dementia. These devices include a Smart Pot
enclosure for plants, a Pressure Sensitive Calendar integrated 
with Google Assistant, and a Smart Pillbox.

Devices deployed in these solutions include Raspberry Pis, 
Arduino, and various analog sensors specific to the devices purpose.

### To Do(s)

#### Functionality
* [ ] Smart PyPot - Isolate LED code for readability
* [ ] Smart PyPot - Integrate experimental Arduino board
* [ ] Pressure Sensitive Calendar - Establish reliability of conductive/resistive materials

#### Quality of Life
* [ ] Automate Arduino code uploads with RPi shell scripts
* [ ] Automate RPi + Arduino code uploads using git
